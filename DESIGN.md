# Design System: Idea Field

## Overview

**Creative North Star: “The data-sublime field, made useful.”**

Idea Field borrows the disciplined density of barcode columns and data lattices, then puts it to work on a human task: keeping a rough idea visible until it has a next move. Pure black and warm white make the field feel like an instrument. Lime is reserved for an active signal, a current state, or the action that places a thought. The page uses a capture bay, an index, and a reading surface instead of a grid of generic cards.

## Rules

- One black field, one warm white reading layer, one lime signal.
- Dense mono labels are for state and measurement; prose stays in the sans voice.
- Rows are the content structure. Avoid rounded containers, shadows, and KPI walls.
- A selected idea gains a quiet dark surface and lime signal bars; state is never communicated by color alone.
- Motion is limited to the first field reveal and the current reading change, with a reduced-motion fallback.
